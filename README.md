# shmup
A shooter game based on Phaser framework

## CONCEPT

__RPG rogue-like retro shoot'em up__

## FEATURES

* procedural background terrain
* rich enemy shoot patterns

## TODO'S

* death / replay sequences
* rich player shoot patterns (multiple streams, lateral pods, auto-aiming streams, homing missiles)
* proportional upgrades (and level ups)

##Â KNOWN BUGS

* Massive enemy shoot salves (seems capped, by the pool ?)
* endless scroll : seemless loop (offset bug + tileable/infinite terrain generation)

## Credits

Profund greetings to Open Tyrian graphics (sprites, tilemaps). Helped me a lot to prototype fast.
